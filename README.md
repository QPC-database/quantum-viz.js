Sqore is a configurable tool for rendering quantum circuits. With the increasing demand for quantum libraries and educational tools, quantum circuits provide an intuitive way to visualize and understand quantum algorithms. Sqore is a lightweight library that can be easily integrated into any project. It aims to be easily configurable while allowing complex user interactions, such as toggling between different measurement outcomes.
